Okay I need to create a tool for interviewing front end developer candidates specializing in html, css, and typescript. We do not need react just yet for the purpose of this project.

I want a problem for the candidate to solve that will include the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- Typescript

Have it simulate the experiece of building blocks and template for adobe edge delivery system, which is to say blocks that will injest data from typescript 'we can simulate an api call' and provide them with a data model, and have them build out some simple components. Perhaps what we could consider for the first problem is building out a user profile page, consuming the content from a simualted api call, and then building out the components to display the data.

I want to be able to have the candidate build out the components in a way that is easy to understand and easy to follow.

I need a text editor and I need their code rendered in real time.

They should be able to toggle between HTML, CSS, and Typescript.

I need to be able to see the code in real time and I need to be able to see the results of the code in real time.
